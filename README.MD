# React Projects

This repository contains code for projects I have built while learning React (FreeCodeCamp course). Few months later I rebuilt those projects using React Hooks and Typescript.

## Projects
- [Calculator](https://wojwozniak.github.io/tsx-calculator/)
- [Drum Machine](https://wojwozniak.github.io/tsx-drum-machine/)
- [Markdown Previewer](https://wojwozniak.github.io/tsx-markdown-previewer/)
- [Pomodoro Clock](https://wojwozniak.github.io/tsx-pomodoro-clock/)
- [Random Quote Machine](https://wojwozniak.github.io/tsx-random-quote/)

By builing those projects I have earned React certificate from FreeCodeCamp.
