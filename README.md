# Random Quote Machine
This is my first of freeCodeCamp.org Front-End Libraries Certification Projects. First version of it was finished few months ago, but I redone it using hooks and typescript!  
<a href="https://wojwozniak.github.io/tsx-random-quote/">You can check out this project here</a>   
Used <a href="https://zenquotes.io/">Inspirational quotes API</a> and <a href="https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/">CORS Anywhere</a> to complete this project!
